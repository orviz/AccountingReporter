Accounting metric reporter.

# Definition
Make accounting reports from metrics gathered through connectors (GridEngine, ..)

# Connectors

A connector's duty consists in compute several metrics (CPU Time, Wallclock
Time, Efficiency, ..) by retrieving data from a given system's accounting.

## GridEngine connector (through SQL)

Instead of using either the accounting text file or the XML interface
offered by `qacct`, a SQL connector is the one offered to deal with 
GridEngine accounting data.

The connector itself does not store the data into a SQL database, it 
relies in an external script that does this job (e.g. cron basis). One 
solution is the one suggested [here](http://blog.adslweb.net/serendipity/article/270/Load-Grid-Engine-accounting-file-into-MySQL).


# Formatters
Formatters represent the accounting data (e.g. charts, text, ..)

## Charts
Using [pygal](http://pygal.org/).


# Renderers
Renderers stamp the content generated by the formatters.

## PDF
Generate PDF reports.


# Usage
```python
import achus.reporter
import achus.collector

# FIXME this should be moved to a/the configuration file.
